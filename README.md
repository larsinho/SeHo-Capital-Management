# SeHo-Capital-Management


SeHo Capital Management is a quantitative investment management company trading in global financial markets, dedicated to harvest risk premiums for its investors via advanced risk management tools.
The Fund will strictly invest according to the following tenants:

-	SeHo Capital Management utilizes mathematical models to allocate assets in order to maximize return for a given risk tolerance (efficient frontier)
-	Risk is quantified not only through known factors (market correlation, HML and SMB) but also via more recent factors such as Bakerâ€™s policy uncertainty (https://www.policyuncertainty.com/).
-	However, the Fund has the flexibility to use several financial instruments to control its risk exposure. 
-	SeHo Capital Management seeks to invest in large companies with a healthy liquidity, solid balance sheet, predictable cash flow and good corporate governance.
-	SeHo Capital Management will provide its investors with a monthly newsletter to illustrate the current asset allocation. 
-	Hence, in order to facilitate thorough analyses, the Fund restricts its total number of assets at any given point in time to XX.
